# DataAnalysis
The code analyses and visualizes various tabular datasets.

The following questions are answered in the provided notebook.

1. Make a box plot for the number of sunspot dataset. Report the minimum, maximum, lower quartile, median and upper quartile values of the dataset. What fraction of the dataset are outliers?


2. Using the GRB catalog data that is provided to you, calculate what is the probability that if we identify a GRB as short (T90 < 2 seconds), it has a fluence of the order of 10^{−4 } 𝑒𝑟𝑔/𝑐𝑚^2 ? 

3. Determine the fraction of probability contained within the +/- 1, 2 and 3 sigma zone around the mean of the following probability distribution functions (please see the attached file - Probability_functions).

4. A person in general may cough 0.01% the time, however, this season's common cold has increased the symptom of coughing to 15% . In a doctor's clinic, there are 50 people, out of which 60% of them are sick. What is the probability of a random person in the room is sick given he coughs?

5. Write a function in python to estimate the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of a given random variable. Demonstrate the estimate of the values for an example random variable and cross check the values obtained with that from scipy.stats for the example random variate considered. 

6. Plot and compare the moments of the normal, uniform and Laplace distributions using the above function. Which distribution is more tailed than normal? 

7. A book club classifies members as heavy, medium, or light purchasers, and separate
mailings are prepared for each of these groups. Overall, 20% of the members are
heavy purchasers, 30% medium, and 50% light. A member is not classified into a
group until 18 months after joining the club, but a test is made of the feasibility
of using the first 3 months’ purchases to classify members. The  percentages obtained from existing records of individuals classified as heavy, medium,
or light purchasers is shown in the attached table. 
If a member purchases no books in the first 3 months, what is the probability
that the member is a light purchaser?
